# Documentation Usage Guidelines

## ALWAYS start by reading [`docs/RULES.md`](docs/RULES.md) and making sure you follow them.

## NEXT READ THE RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION

### Pre-Task Protocol

1. **Always start with docs/INDEX.md** - Review the document index for relevant
   documentation
2. Identify specific documents needed from the Quick Task Lookup table in the
   index
3. Consult product documents from [`docs/product`](docs/product)
4. Consult technical references from [`docs/tech`](docs/tech)

### Post-Task Protocol

1. Update the single authoritative source for any changed information
2. Update cross-references if new relationships are created
3. Mark task completion in [`docs/progress.md`](docs/progress.md)
4. Update [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md) if new documents are created
