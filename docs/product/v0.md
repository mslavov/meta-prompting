## Functional Requirements

### Prompt Creation (Priority: High)

- **Goal Input:** Users enter a plain English goal describing the
  desired prompt outcome.

- **Clarification Engine:** The system generates and presents a
  structured sequence of clarifying questions; users respond inline.

- **Prompt Generation:** The app synthesizes a variable-driven prompt
  template based on answers, with automatic variable identification.

### Prompt Testing (Priority: High)

- **Model Selector:** Users choose LLM provider and model (e.g., OpenAI,
  Anthropic) and set parameters such as temperature or top-p.

- **Variable Input:** Users are presented with variable fields and can
  input sample values for real-time prompt resolution.

- **Prompt Execution:** The app generates and displays the prompt as
  seen by the LLM, with actual output shown to the user.

### Copy/Export (Priority: Medium)

- **Copy-to-Clipboard:** Single-click copying of both the generated
  prompt template and response results.

### Account & Usage (Priority: Low)

## Narrative

Imagine Dana, an AI prompt engineer, is tasked with designing complex
instructions for her company’s chatbot. Normally she’d wrestle with
prompt structure, tweak variables, and manually iterate on
instructions—hours lost in the process. With the meta-prompt SaaS app,
Dana simply types her overall goal. Instantly, the platform asks three
sharp follow-up questions, soliciting details and clarifying
expectations. Within minutes, she receives a neat, variable-filled
prompt template.

Dana selects 'OpenAI GPT-4' as her model, keys in representative test
values for her variables, and triggers a test run. The app renders
results in real time, showing both the generated prompt and the LLM's
output. Satisfied, Dana copies the template to her documentation and
continues with confidence. Developers on her team now use the same tool
to streamline prompt integration into products—reducing trial-and-error
and making their releases quicker and more reliable. Soon, the entire
team relies on the platform as an essential part of their workflow,
finding productivity up and frustration dramatically down.

## Success Metrics
